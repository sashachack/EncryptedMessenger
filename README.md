4. `cd` into `./server` and run `npm install`.
5. Start the `server` by running `npm start` in the `./server` directory.
6. Once the `server` is up and running, switch to the `./client` directory and run `npm run dev`.
7. The `client` will be accessible at `localhost:3000`.

## Testing

2. Go to `localhost:3000` in a broswer window and sign up for an account as instructed
3. Open a secondary browser window and navigate to `localhost:3000` once again. Create a new account to behave as another user
